\section{SAML: Security Assertion Markup Language}
% Confronto con oauth2
Unlike OAuth, this protocol deals with both authentication and
authorization.

\subsection{Overview}
Uses already existing technologies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SOAP
    \item XML Schema
    \item HTTP
    \item XML Signature, for encryption and message validation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Protocol}
SAML protocol describes how SAML elements are packaged with SAML requests
and responses elements.

The most important saml protocol is called "\textit{query}", a service provider
makes a query directly
\subsubsection{SOAP}
The SOAP specification defines the messaging framework, which consists of:
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP#Specification
\begin{itemize}
    \item SOAP processing model,
    \item SOAP extensibility model
    \item SOAP underlying protocol binding framework
    \item SOAP message construct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security}
The standard requires TML v1.0+ for transport layer security, XML signature
and encryption for message-level security.

\section{Comparing SAML and OAuth2}
SAML protocol provides authorization and authentication, on the other hand,
OAuth2 is an authorization protocol, therefore is usually associated with OpenID
to provide authenticaiton too.

SAML uses an XML based protocol to call functions after authentications, Oauth2
uses http redirects.
