\section{Introduction}
\subsection{The problem}
Let's imagine that we have a server that manages a vast list of products. Those
products could be searched, filtered and sorted by different fields, like the
name, color, insertion date and so on.  The search query is submitted, the
server returns a web page with the products, represented in a tabular fashion.

The server becomes popular and is used by million of users, and you start to
think that sharing those search results could be a cool feature.

We want to use third party API to integrate this feture.
% Necessity of communication between client and server.

Different ways to achieve the goal, here are a few of them:
\subsubsection{Direct transmission of the user identifier}
Directly send the user id to the server
\begin{alltt}
    \$ curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/db_auth '\{"user-id": 1\}'
\end{alltt}
I do not want to sped too much time on this one. It is for sure one of the
fastest
and less secure way to communicate the user identity.

Even someone with some basic knowledge of programming could recognize that by changing the
value of \texttt{user-id}, the request would still be valid and you are recognized as
another user.

\subsubsection{Http Basic Authentication}
Http Basic Auth: each API request is signed with a username and a passwrod, encoded in base64
\begin{alltt}
    \$ curl -u Aladdin:OpenSesamus -v http://localhost:8080/basic

    > GET / HTTP/1.1
    > Host: localhost:8080
    > Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW11cw==
    > User-Agent: curl/7.72.0
    > Accept: */*
    ...
\end{alltt}
Since the credentials are neither hashed nor encrypted, your username and password are always visible by
someone who could read the headers.
Therefore this protocol requires an https channel in order to be somewhat secure.

\subsubsection{API Key}
\begin{alltt}
    \$ curl --header Authorization: Apikey 1234567890abcdef
\end{alltt}
API keys make sense when the users of an API are only developers.

\subsubsection{Public/Private Key}
\begin{alltt}
    \$ ssh-keygen -v
    The key fingerprint is:
    SHA256:tFKUq1HLfJ3Iy6toGec804dKXPgx4P6rrL6Tc4S0wVY ale-cci@vagrant

    The key's randomart image is:
    +---[RSA 3072]----+
    |        ..       |
    |       .E        |
    |     . =++ o .   |
    |      *+=++ o    |
    |     o.*So+.     |
    |      =+oooo     |
    |       O+..o     |
    |      *+*.+ .    |
    |     o=*=*oo     |
    +----[SHA256]-----+


    \$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@host
\end{alltt}
Authorization via asymmetric cryptography. Two keys are generate a public and a secret one.
The public key is, as the name suggests, public and everyone could read it.
The client encodes his messages with the private key; the receivers could validate the authenticity of those messages using the public key.

This is one of the safest methods, but it's not viable as we need to distribute in some way the private key to
trusted users.

\subsubsection{OAuth2}
Provide an access token at each client, which they could use to validate their
identity at each API request.  This token could be either valid, expired,
revoked or invalid.

\begin{alltt}
    \$ curl -v --header 'Authorization: Bearer 1234' http://localhost:8080/api

    > GET / HTTP/1.1
    > Host: localhost:8080
    > User-Agent: curl/7.72.0
    > Accept: */*
    > Authorization: Bearer 1234
    ...
\end{alltt}

The OAuth2 protocol provides a secure and standardized way for creating and exchanging those token between client and server.


%==============================================================================
\section{OAuth2 Protocol}
\subsection{Obtain an access token}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        Redirect to the authorization provider.
        \begin{alltt}
    http://google.apis.com?response_type=code\&client_id...
        \end{alltt}

    \item
        If the authorization is successful, the oauth server will redirect to \lstinline{redirect_uri} passing a \lstinline{code}
        as GET parameter. Otherwise \lstinline{error} contains the reason why the authorization was not successful.
        \begin{alltt}
    POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: authorization-server.com

    grant_type=authorization_code
    &code=xxxxxxxxxxx
    &redirect_uri=https://example-app.com/redirect
    &client_id=xxxxxxxxxx
    &client_secret=xxxxxxxxxx
        \end{alltt}

        \textit{If an authorization code is used more than once, the authorization server must deny the subsequent request.}

    \item
        The client exchanges the \lstinline{code}, called also "grant token", with the server to obtain an
        \\
        \lstinline{access\_token}.
    \item The server returns the access token with additional informations, such
        as expire date and JWT.
    \item
        The client uses the access token for APIs requests.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Revoke an access token}

%==============================================================================
\section{SAML: Security Assertion Markup Language}
% Confronto con oauth2
Unlike OAuth, this protocol deals with both authentication and
authorization.

\subsection{Overview}
Uses already existing technologies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SOAP
    \item XML Schema
    \item HTTP
    \item XML Signature, for encryption and message validation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Protocol}
SAML protocol describes how SAML elements are packaged with SAML requests
and responses elements.

The most important saml protocol is called "\textit{query}", a service provider
makes a query directly
\subsubsection{SOAP}
The SOAP specification defines the messaging framework, which consists of:
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP#Specification
\begin{itemize}
    \item SOAP processing model,
    \item SOAP extensibility model
    \item SOAP underlying protocol binding framework
    \item SOAP message construct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security}
The standard requires TML v1.0+ for transport layer security, XML signature
and encryption for message-level security.

\section{Comparing SAML and OAuth2}




%==============================================================================
\section{SSO with OpenID}
\subsection{Second problem}
We want to delegate the process of authentication of username and password
to an external service, then if the user is registered in our platform we
allow him in.

\subsection{JWT}
Shorthand JSON Web Token, encoded token that contains the necessary
informations to identify the user.

\subsection{JWS e JWE}
Token could be signed, encrypted or both.

\subsection{JWS Validation}
Verify the SHA256 signature
