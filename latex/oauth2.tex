\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The problem}
Leave this after rather than before, (include an hook at the beginning of the
introduction)

Just imagine a website that it's main functionality is manage the warehouse of a
large number of products.
The functionalities available could be numerous, here are a few:

\begin{itemize}
    \item retrieve the list of products in the warehouse
    \item Add or remove a product
    \item Register a shipment
    \item Create the list of barcode for a shipment
\end{itemize}



Let's imagine that we have a server that manages a vast list of products. Those
products could be searched, filtered and sorted by different fields, like the
name, color, insertion date and so on.  The search query is submitted, the
server returns a web page with the products, represented in a tabular fashion.

The server becomes popular and is used by million of users, and you start to
think that sharing those search results could be a cool feature.

We want to use third party API to integrate this feture.
% Necessity of communication between client and server.

Different ways to achieve the goal, here are a few of them:
\subsubsection{Direct transmission of the user identifier}
Directly send the user id to the server
\begin{alltt}
    \$ curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/db_auth '\{"user-id": 1\}'
\end{alltt}
I do not want to sped too much time on this one. It is for sure one of the
fastest
and less secure way to communicate the user identity.

Even someone with some basic knowledge of programming could recognize that by changing the
value of \texttt{user-id}, the request would still be valid and you are recognized as
another user.

\subsubsection{Http Basic Authentication}
Http Basic Auth: each API request is signed with a username and a passwrod, encoded in base64
\begin{alltt}
    \$ curl -u Aladdin:OpenSesamus -v http://localhost:8080/basic

    > GET / HTTP/1.1
    > Host: localhost:8080
    > Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW11cw==
    > User-Agent: curl/7.72.0
    > Accept: */*
    ...
\end{alltt}
Since the credentials are neither hashed nor encrypted, your username and password are always visible by
someone who could read the headers.
Therefore this protocol requires an https channel in order to be somewhat secure.

\subsubsection{API Key}
\begin{alltt}
    \$ curl --header Authorization: Apikey 1234567890abcdef
\end{alltt}
API keys make sense when the users of an API are only developers.

\subsubsection{Public/Private Key}
\begin{alltt}
    \$ ssh-keygen -v
    The key fingerprint is:
    SHA256:tFKUq1HLfJ3Iy6toGec804dKXPgx4P6rrL6Tc4S0wVY ale-cci@vagrant

    The key's randomart image is:
    +---[RSA 3072]----+
    |        ..       |
    |       .E        |
    |     . =++ o .   |
    |      *+=++ o    |
    |     o.*So+.     |
    |      =+oooo     |
    |       O+..o     |
    |      *+*.+ .    |
    |     o=*=*oo     |
    +----[SHA256]-----+


    \$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@host
\end{alltt}
Authorization via asymmetric cryptography. Two keys are generate a public and a secret one.
The public key is, as the name suggests, public and everyone could read it.
The client encodes his messages with the private key; the receivers could validate the authenticity of those messages using the public key.

This is one of the safest methods, but it's not viable as we need to distribute in some way the private key to
trusted users.

\subsubsection{OAuth2}
Provide an access token at each client, which they could use to validate their
identity at each API request.  This token could be either valid, expired,
revoked or invalid.

\begin{alltt}
    \$ curl -v --header 'Authorization: Bearer 1234' http://localhost:8080/api

    > GET / HTTP/1.1
    > Host: localhost:8080
    > User-Agent: curl/7.72.0
    > Accept: */*
    > Authorization: Bearer 1234
    ...
\end{alltt}

The OAuth2 protocol provides a secure and standardized way for creating and exchanging those token between client and server.


%==============================================================================
\section{OAuth2 Protocol}
\subsection{What is OAuth2?}
Oauth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables a third-party application
to obtain limited access to an HTTP service either on behalf of a resource
owner.
\subsection{Obtain an access token}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        Redirect to the authorization provider.
        \begin{alltt}
    http://google.apis.com?response_type=code\&client_id...
        \end{alltt}

    \item
        If the authorization is successful, the oauth server will redirect to \lstinline{redirect_uri} passing a \lstinline{code}
        as GET parameter. Otherwise \lstinline{error} contains the reason why the authorization was not successful.
        \begin{alltt}
    POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: authorization-server.com

    grant_type=authorization_code
    &code=xxxxxxxxxxx
    &redirect_uri=https://example-app.com/redirect
    &client_id=xxxxxxxxxx
    &client_secret=xxxxxxxxxx
        \end{alltt}

        \textit{If an authorization code is used more than once, the authorization server must deny the subsequent request.}

    \item
        The client exchanges the \lstinline{code}, called also "grant token", with the server to obtain an
        \\
        \lstinline{access\_token}.
    \item The server returns the access token with additional informations, such
        as expire date and JWT.
    \item
        The client uses the access token for APIs requests.
\end{enumerate}

%==============================================================================
\section{SAML: Security Assertion Markup Language}
% Confronto con oauth2
Unlike OAuth, this protocol deals with both authentication and
authorization.

\subsection{Overview}
Uses already existing technologies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SOAP
    \item XML Schema
    \item HTTP
    \item XML Signature, for encryption and message validation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Protocol}
SAML protocol describes how SAML elements are packaged with SAML requests
and responses elements.

The most important saml protocol is called "\textit{query}", a service provider
makes a query directly
\subsubsection{SOAP}
The SOAP specification defines the messaging framework, which consists of:
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP#Specification
\begin{itemize}
    \item SOAP processing model,
    \item SOAP extensibility model
    \item SOAP underlying protocol binding framework
    \item SOAP message construct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security}
The standard requires TML v1.0+ for transport layer security, XML signature
and encryption for message-level security.


%==============================================================================
\section{Comparing SAML and OAuth2}
SAML protocol provides authorization and authentication, on the other hand,
OAuth2 is an authorization protocol, therefore is usually associated with OpenID
to provide authenticaiton too.

SAML uses an XML based protocol to call functions after authentications, Oauth2
uses http redirects.




%==============================================================================
\section{SSO with OpenID}
\subsection{Second problem}
We want to delegate the process of authentication of username and password
to an external service, then if the user is registered in our platform we
allow him in.

\subsection{JWT}
JWT is an internet standard for creating JSON based access tokens. It asserts
some number of claims in the token itself, so that authentication protocols that
uses it can be considered completely stateless.

In other words, if i give a JWT to a completely different service
it is completely able to verify and authenticate the request, even without
database access.

The key concept behind JWT is encryption, it could be symmetric or asymmetric.
With that said, the latter one is preferred, for reasons that i will explain
later.

In a zero thrust architecture, it is really rare that symmetric encryption is
used to create JWTs. If just one server is hacked, then all the encryption in
use is invalidated, and unusable.

JWT are composed by three  parts:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Header: contains expiration, when it was created, encryption
        algorithm, etc.
    \item Data: data contained in the jwt.
    \item Signature: encrypted checksum obtained combining header and data.
\end{enumerate}

The data cannot be deliberately modified, thanks to the signature, the server
could easily verify if the token is valid or it has been altered.

JWT created with an asymmetric key, can be generated by one server and verified
by everyone thanks to public keys.

\subsection{Access tokens}
Since we are able to trust JWTs  without the use of a database, they offer the
main advantage to not issue database calls to verify the user identity.


Using JWTs instead of cookies for authentications grants the main advantage to
not issue a database, but as they sail "with great power comes great
responsibility", in fact if the token is stolen by someone, you cannot do
anything about it.

Since it is a completely stateless protocol, using JWT as is, there is no way
you can revoke access to the token. No database calls means that there is
nowhere to store that JWT is been revoked.

It is true that it is not easy to steal them, because OAuth2 protocol specifies
that all interactions between client and server are made using SSL protocol, but
it is not impossible.

One workaround to this problem is to make JWTs expire in a short lapse of time,
usually 15 minutes to an hour, then force clients either to re-authenticate or
provide them an extra token (\textit{refresh\_token}), used to re-claim
authentication on their behalf.

Refresh tokens are exactly like session: JWTs stored in the database, with a
long or usually without expiry date.
They should securely stored, in order to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks.

Even with refresh token we have the big advantage to query the database
approximately once each 15 minutes per user.

With that said, it still lies the problem that there is no easy way to revoke a
token. Even if a refresh token is deleted from the database, it's corrispettive
access token is still usable until expiry.

\subsection{Pros and Cons of JWTs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Pros:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stateless
    \item great for api
    \item secure
    \item carry useful and trusted information
    \item can store information that can drive UX without backend interaction.
    \item No need for a centralized database.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item sharing secrets in a microservice architecture.
    \item Key management: where to put public key; how to kow if it's valid and
        deprecated keys.
    \item very tricky to consume correctly
    \item careful storage of refresh token
    \item Impossibility to revoke tokens
    \item Insecure implementation libraries (no algorithm)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{JWS e JWE}
Token could be signed, encrypted or both.

\subsection{JWS Validation}
Verify the SHA256 signature
