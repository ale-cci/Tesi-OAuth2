\subsection{What you will find in this paper}
The goal of this document is to explain how does the OAuth2 protocol work and
how it can be implemented and used within a webserver.

Further down we will see the strength and weaknesses of this protocol and when
it's best adopt this industry standard, where it's adopted and what are it's use
cases.

We will see what OpenID connect and the meaning of Identity Provider, Single SignOn
and JWT.
\subsection{Reading target}
This paper is suited for people who are new to authentication protocols, want to
integrate Oauth2 with their webserver, or want to know in depth how JWT and
OpenID works.

\section{Introduction}
The OAuth2 protocol is often confused with API keys for their similar use cases,
but there is a small distinction that makes the former highly more flexible.

If you are already a user of a service and you want to access your data
programmatically, then sure, you can use API keys, but if a third party
application wants to access your data it will not ask for your username and
password, but it will use OAuth2 for access you private reources.

\subsection{Authentication and Authorization}
Authorization and authentication my sound similar to one another, but they are
two distinct concepts, used in identity and access management:
authentication says who you are, authorization says what actions you can
perform.

OAuth2 is an authorization protocol, which means that it's only use is for
granting access to protected resources to a client.

\subsection{Terminology}

\subsection{The protocol}
It all starts with a specifically crafted url:
\begin{lstlisting}
https://www.googleapis.com
    ?redirect_uri=http://localhost:3030
    &client_id=
    &scope=email read-contacts
    &grant=code
\end{lstlisting}

In the login prompt, users sees the assertion that will be inserted in the
oauth2 jwt.

OAuth2 flow is always between website A and B, the user has only to consent the
oauth2 request.

It all starts with a specially crafted url, besides the host, it includes extra
information that says what the host should do, they include the registered
application, the redirect uri (once discord is done the authorization the host
will send you there). Response type is for saying that you want a code back, and
scope is the actual data that you want to access.


\subsection{Main entities in authorization protocols}
Leave this after rather than before, (include an hook at the beginning of the
introduction)

Just imagine a website that it's main functionality is manage the warehouse of a
large number of products.
The functionalities available could be numerous, here are a few:

\begin{itemize}
    \item retrieve the list of products in the warehouse
    \item Add or remove a product
    \item Register a shipment
    \item Create the list of barcode for a shipment
\end{itemize}

Let's imagine that we have a server that manages a vast list of products. Those
products could be searched, filtered and sorted by different fields, like the
name, color, insertion date and so on.  The search query is submitted, the
server returns a web page with the products, represented in a tabular fashion.

The server becomes popular and is used by million of users, and you start to
think that sharing those search results could be a cool feature.

We want to use third party API to integrate this feature.
% Necessity of communication between client and server.

Different ways to achieve the goal, here are a few of them:
\subsubsection{Direct transmission of the user identifier}
Directly send the user id to the server
\begin{alltt}
    \$ curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/db_auth '\{"user-id": 1\}'
\end{alltt}
I do not want to sped too much time on this one. It is for sure one of the
fastest
and less secure way to communicate the user identity.

Even someone with some basic knowledge of programming could recognize that by changing the
value of \texttt{user-id}, the request would still be valid and you are recognized as
another user.

\subsubsection{Http Basic Authentication}
Http Basic Auth: each API request is signed with a username and a passwrod, encoded in base64
\begin{alltt}
    \$ curl -u Aladdin:OpenSesamus -v http://localhost:8080/basic

    > GET / HTTP/1.1
    > Host: localhost:8080
    > Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW11cw==
    > User-Agent: curl/7.72.0
    > Accept: */*
    ...
\end{alltt}
Since the credentials are neither hashed nor encrypted, your username and password are always visible by
someone who could read the headers.
Therefore this protocol requires an https channel in order to be somewhat secure.

\subsubsection{API Key}
\begin{alltt}
    \$ curl --header Authorization: Apikey 1234567890abcdef
\end{alltt}
API keys make sense when the users of an API are only developers.

\subsubsection{Public/Private Key}
\begin{alltt}
    \$ ssh-keygen -v
    The key fingerprint is:
    SHA256:tFKUq1HLfJ3Iy6toGec804dKXPgx4P6rrL6Tc4S0wVY ale-cci@vagrant

    The key's randomart image is:
    +---[RSA 3072]----+
    |        ..       |
    |       .E        |
    |     . =++ o .   |
    |      *+=++ o    |
    |     o.*So+.     |
    |      =+oooo     |
    |       O+..o     |
    |      *+*.+ .    |
    |     o=*=*oo     |
    +----[SHA256]-----+


    \$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@host
\end{alltt}
Authorization via asymmetric cryptography. Two keys are generate a public and a secret one.
The public key is, as the name suggests, public and everyone could read it.
The client encodes his messages with the private key; the receivers could validate the authenticity of those messages using the public key.

This is one of the safest methods, but it's not viable as we need to distribute in some way the private key to
trusted users.

\subsubsection{OAuth2}
Provide an access token at each client, which they could use to validate their
identity at each API request.  This token could be either valid, expired,
revoked or invalid.

\begin{alltt}
    \$ curl -v --header 'Authorization: Bearer 1234' http://localhost:8080/api

    > GET / HTTP/1.1
    > Host: localhost:8080
    > User-Agent: curl/7.72.0
    > Accept: */*
    > Authorization: Bearer 1234
    ...
\end{alltt}

The OAuth2 protocol provides a secure and standardized way for creating and exchanging those token between client and server.


%==============================================================================
\section{OAuth2 Protocol}
\subsection{What is OAuth2?}
Oauth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables a third-party application
to obtain limited access to an HTTP service either on behalf of a resource
owner.
\subsection{Obtain an access token}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        Redirect to the authorization provider.
        \begin{alltt}
    http://google.apis.com?response_type=code\&client_id...
        \end{alltt}

    \item
        If the authorization is successful, the oauth server will redirect to \lstinline{redirect_uri} passing a \lstinline{code}
        as GET parameter. Otherwise \lstinline{error} contains the reason why the authorization was not successful.
        \begin{alltt}
    POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: authorization-server.com

    grant_type=authorization_code
    &code=xxxxxxxxxxx
    &redirect_uri=https://example-app.com/redirect
    &client_id=xxxxxxxxxx
    &client_secret=xxxxxxxxxx
        \end{alltt}

        \textit{If an authorization code is used more than once, the authorization server must deny the subsequent request.}

    \item
        The client exchanges the \lstinline{code}, called also "grant token", with the server to obtain an
        \\
        \lstinline{access\_token}.
    \item The server returns the access token with additional informations, such
        as expire date and JWT.
    \item
        The client uses the access token for APIs requests.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Revoke an access token}
Something something



%==============================================================================
\section{More Oauth}
%================================================================================

%==============================================================================
In the early days, all was easy, you simply gave your username and password to
one service, so it can log in to your account, and grab whatever information
they wanted.

There is no guarantee that an organization will keep your credentials safe, or
it won't use your credentials to access more sensitive information than
necessary.

Today we have agreed to standards, to allow one service to securely allow access
to another.
The first one is oauth (2.0), a security standard where you give an application
permissions to access your data in another application, instead of giving them
username and password, it gives them a key that allows it to access data or do
things on your behalf, on another application.

The steps to grant permissions, or consents are often referred as authorizations
or delegated authorizations.

Once more, you can take back that key whenever you wish.

You have discover an awesome website that tells you a terrible pun every day,
and you want to share it between all your contacts on your mailing list (why
not).
But writing an email to every person in your contact list every day sounds like
a lot of work.

Good thing terrible pun of the day has a feature to email all your friends.
1st you go to your email provider, then you are redirect to your email service.
Firstly it checks if you are logged in, if you are not, it asks you to
authenticate and then it opens a session where it presents the question: "do you
want to give the website access to your contacts?"

Assuming you have not changed your mind you click allow, now you are redirected
to the website and the application can now access your contacts.

Visible and invisible steps to grant consent.
Before going in the depths of oauth2 let's map some terminology
- resource owner (you)
- the client (the application that want to access your data)
- authorization server (application that knows the resource owner, where the
resource owner already has an account)
- resource server (server that contains the data that the client wants to use on
behalf of the resource owner, sometimes it is the same as the authorization
server)

authorization and resource servers could be a third party service trusted by the
resource server.

- redirect uri, where the client will be redirect after authorization.
- response type: type of the information the client expects to receive (most
common code, (authorization code))
- scope: permission that the client wants
- consent: authorization server takes the scopes and verifies wether or not it
want to give client permissions
- client\_id: used to identify the client with the authorization server
- client\_secret: secret password that only client and auth server knows
- auth\_code: short lived code that server sends to the client
- access\_token: key the client will use to communicate with the resource server.

(oauth2 protocol explained)

client doen't use the access token, it's jibbrish.

%==============================================================================
\section{PKCE}
PKCE (proof key for code exchange), superset feature on top of oauth2


Why should you care:
security is important, only fully server side hosted application can securely
store secrets. Desktop and mobile applications are public, and it's keys cannot
be protected.

Public applications can be exploited via authorization code interception,
whereby a malicious application running alongside your application can intercept
the authorization code and obtain authorization token.
Oauth2.1 specification will mandate that all implementation of the authorization
grant type use PKCE.

%==============================================================================
\section{OpenID connect}

oauth2.0 is designed only for authorization and granting access to data and
feature from one application to another.
OAuth is like giving an application a key, that doesn't tell anything about who
you are.
OIDC is a thin layer that sits on top of Oauth2.0 that add functionality around
login and profile information about the person who is logged in.
Instead of a key, openid is like giving a person a badge. A badge not only gives
permission but also some basic information of who your are.

OIDC enstablish a client to perform a login session.
When an authorization server supports oidc it referred as an identity provider,
since it provides information about the resource owner back to the client.

OpenID connect, enables scenarios where one login can be shared among multiple
applications. It is also known as single sign on.
For example an application can support SSO with social networking services (i.e.
facebook or twitter) so that a user can use a login that he already has and it's
comfortable using it.

Example with ATM. atm is the client and it communicates with the bank. The bank
card is the token issued by the bank. Not only gives access to the atm to your
bank account, but holds some basic information about you, when the card expires
and why you are.
ATM cannot work without the infrastructure of the bank.

On top of oauth, a specific scope of openid is used. The authorization server
goes to all the steps listed before and issues the client an authorization code
via the client's browser.
The key difference is that the client receives both an access token and an id
token.

ID token is a specifically formatted token (JWT). Client can extract your user
id, your email, when you logged in, when it expires, and it can tell if anyone
has tried to tamper with the jwt.

Fields contained in the jwt are called claims.
There is also a standard way that a client can ask additional information from the
authorization server, such as the email address.

%==============================================================================
\section{JWT}
\subsection{JWT}
JWT is an internet standard for creating JSON based access tokens. It asserts
some number of claims in the token itself, so that authentication protocols that
uses it can be considered completely stateless.

In other words, if i give a JWT to a completely different service
it is completely able to verify and authenticate the request, even without
database access.

The key concept behind JWT is encryption, it could be symmetric or asymmetric.
With that said, the latter one is preferred, for reasons that i will explain
later.

In a zero thrust architecture, it is really rare that symmetric encryption is
used to create JWTs. If just one server is hacked, then all the encryption in
use is invalidated, and unusable.

JWT are composed by three  parts:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Header: contains expiration, when it was created, encryption
        algorithm, etc.
    \item Data: data contained in the jwt.
    \item Signature: encrypted checksum obtained combining header and data.
\end{enumerate}

The data cannot be deliberately modified, thanks to the signature, the server
could easily verify if the token is valid or it has been altered.

JWT created with an asymmetric key, can be generated by one server and verified
by everyone thanks to public keys.

\subsection{Access tokens}
Since we are able to trust JWTs  without the use of a database, they offer the
main advantage to not issue database calls to verify the user identity.


Using JWTs instead of cookies for authentications grants the main advantage to
not issue a database, but as they sail "with great power comes great
responsibility", in fact if the token is stolen by someone, you cannot do
anything about it.

Since it is a completely stateless protocol, using JWT as is, there is no way
you can revoke access to the token. No database calls means that there is
nowhere to store that JWT is been revoked.

It is true that it is not easy to steal them, because OAuth2 protocol specifies
that all interactions between client and server are made using SSL protocol, but
it is not impossible.

One workaround to this problem is to make JWTs expire in a short lapse of time,
usually 15 minutes to an hour, then force clients either to re-authenticate or
provide them an extra token (\textit{refresh\_token}), used to re-claim
authentication on their behalf.

Refresh tokens are exactly like session: JWTs stored in the database, with a
long or usually without expiry date.
They should securely stored, in order to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks.

Even with refresh token we have the big advantage to query the database
approximately once each 15 minutes per user.

With that said, it still lies the problem that there is no easy way to revoke a
token. Even if a refresh token is deleted from the database, it's corrispettive
access token is still usable until expiry.

\subsection{Pros and Cons of JWTs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Pros:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stateless
    \item great for api
    \item secure
    \item carry useful and trusted information
    \item can store information that can drive UX without backend interaction.
    \item No need for a centralized database.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item sharing secrets in a microservice architecture.
    \item Key management: where to put public key; how to kow if it's valid and
        deprecated keys.
    \item very tricky to consume correctly
    \item careful storage of refresh token
    \item Impossibility to revoke tokens
    \item Insecure implementation libraries (no algorithm)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{JWS e JWE}
Token could be signed, encrypted or both.

\subsection{JWS Validation}
Verify the SHA256 signature
