\subsection{What you will find in this paper}
The goal of this document is to illustrate the OAuth2 framework and
how it can be used, by implementing a standalone micro-service.

Further down we will point out the strength and weaknesses of this protocol; when
it's best adopt this industry standard, where it's adopted and what are it's use
cases.

We will see what OpenID Connect is, the meaning of Identity Provider, Single
Sign On and what JWT is.

\subsection{Reading target}
This dissertation is suited for people who have a basic grasp on what is
authentication/authorization, and want to integrate OAuth2 with their web
server, or want to know in depth how JWT and OpenID works.

\subsection{Examples}
Alongside explanations, there will be included some code examples, written in
Python.

Why Python? You may ask, because i think it is arguably one of the most readable
and concise languages out there.
